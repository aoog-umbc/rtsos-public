# For Mie phase matrix, IPT has to be bigger than 0.

# -1000  is reserved for detector.
# if -1000 is used, the second number is the optical depth where the detector is located.
# if want to measuer radiance just under water, make taudet = tau oi +small number
# the third number will be ignored.

# IF EFLRSC/=0 FOR THE OCEAN LAYER
# fluorescence flag WILL BE TURN ON
# EFLRSC IN OCEAN WILL BE THE EMITTING IRRADIANCE OF THE FLUORESCENCE.

#-100 is reserved for air-sea interface.
#-100 w re im blank, blank, blank
# w: the wind speed, 
# re and im: real and imaginary refrective index

#-200 is reserved for lambertian bottom.
#-200, rho,flam,re, im,blank,blank
# rho: lambertian single scattering albedo of the surface
# flam: fraction of the incident irradiance is reflected.
# re and im are the real and imaginary refractive index of the specular reflection if flam<1

#-201 is reserved for unified pBRDF formula See Eq. (18) Feng Xu et al, OL, 2011 but with p(\mu) changed to Breon model p(\mu)=\mu/\pi.
#-201 a k b eta rm im

# NO system configuration is allowed beyond bottom.
# Don't use numbers smaller than -1000 for ipt.
#for additional forms of layers, more negative number could be used.
