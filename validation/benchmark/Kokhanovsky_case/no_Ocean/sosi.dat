# For Mie phase matrix, IPT has to be bigger than 0.

# -1000  is reserved for detector.
# if -1000 is used, the second number is the optical depth where the detector is located.
# if want to measuer radiance just under water, make taudet = tau oi +small number
# the third number will be ignored.

# IF EFLRSC/=0 FOR THE OCEAN LAYER
# fluorescence flag WILL BE TURN ON
# EFLRSC IN OCEAN WILL BE THE EMITTING IRRADIANCE OF THE FLUORESCENCE.

#-100 is reserved for air-sea interface.
#if -100 is used, the following two numbers are the wind speed and refrective index
# the current plan does not included wind ruffled case.  reserved anyway.

#-200 is reserved for lambertian bottom.
#if -200 is used, the second number is single scattering albedo, 
# the third number will be ignored

# NO system configuration is allowed beyond bottom.
# Don't use numbers smaller than -1000 for ipt.
#for additional forms of layers, more negative number could be used.
